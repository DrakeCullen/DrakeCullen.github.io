# Project 3 - Client-side JS App using React

### I created a game that I have called Cloud Jumper using ReactJS.

<br/>

My game satisfies all of the requirements. It uses 11 React components, 3 JSON files, and 18 tests.
<br/>


To install the game, clone this github repository. Next, run "npm install". You can either run the unit tests by typing "npm run test" or play the game by running "npm start". You can also play the game by going to this link https://drakecullen.github.io/.

<br/>

Move the player left and right by holding the arrow keeps. Land on clouds to jump, and grab coins to earn points!

<br/>

All my test cases passed!
